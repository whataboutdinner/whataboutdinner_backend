      {
        order: 2,
        instruction: "In a large bowl, combine sliced cabbage and salt. Using clean hands, massage and squeeze the cabbage firmly for about 10 minutes. The cabbage will soften and release liquid, creating its own brine."

        order: 9,
        instruction: "Check daily, pressing down on the cabbage if needed to keep it submerged. If using a regular lid, briefly unscrew it daily to release built-up gases."
      },
      {
        order: 10,
        instruction: "Ferment for 1-4 weeks, depending on your preference. The longer it ferments, the more sour it becomes. Taste after one week and continue fermenting until it reaches your desired flavor."

        order: 11,
        instruction: "Once fermentation is complete, seal the jar tightly and refrigerate. Sauerkraut will keep for several months in the refrigerator."

      },
      {
        order: 4,

      },
      {
        order: 5,
        instruction: "Cover the jar with a tightly woven cloth, coffee filter, or paper towel secured with a rubber band. This allows the kombucha to breathe while keeping out dust, fruit flies, and other contaminants."

      },
      {
        order: 8,
        instruction: "After 7 days, start tasting the kombucha daily using a straw. It should taste tangy and slightly sweet. The longer it ferments, the less sweet and more vinegary it becomes."
      },
      {
        order: 9,
        instruction: "When the kombucha reaches your desired flavor, prepare for bottling. Reserve 1-2 cups of the liquid with the SCOBY for your next batch."

      {
        order: 10,
        instruction: "For a second fermentation (to create carbonation and add flavors): Pour the kombucha into airtight bottles, leaving about 1-2 inches of headspace. Add optional flavorings like fruit, herbs, or juice (about 1-2 tablespoons per 16 oz bottle)."
      },
      {
        order: 11,
        instruction: "Seal the bottles tightly and let them sit at room temperature for 1-3 days for the second fermentation. This creates carbonation and infuses the flavors."

        order: 12,
        instruction: "Refrigerate the bottles to slow fermentation and carbonation. Always open bottles carefully as pressure can build up during the second fermentation."
