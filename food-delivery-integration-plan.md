# Food Delivery Service Integration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for integrating food delivery service apps directly within the What About Dinner application, allowing hosts to select restaurants from delivery services and enabling party members to place and pay for individual orders that are aggregated for the host.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. Embed food delivery service interfaces within the What About Dinner app
2. Allow hosts to select restaurants from delivery services
3. Share selected restaurant menus with party members
4. Enable individual meal selection and payment by party members
5. Aggregate orders and payments on the host's profile
6. Submit consolidated orders to the delivery service

### Technical Requirements
1. API integrations with major food delivery services
2. Secure payment processing system
3. Real-time order synchronization
4. Mobile-responsive embedded views

## Integration Options

### Option 1: Direct API Integration
- Integrate directly with APIs from DoorDash, Uber Eats, Grubhub, etc.
- Pros: Seamless user experience, full control over UI
- Cons: Complex implementation, requires partnership agreements, subject to API changes

### Option 2: Iframe/Webview Embedding
- Embed the delivery service websites within the app using iframes or webviews
- Pros: Simpler implementation, always up-to-date menus
- Cons: Less control over user experience, potential issues with cookies and sessions

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
- Use APIs for restaurant selection and menu data
- Redirect to delivery service for final checkout
- Pros: Balance of control and simplicity
- Cons: Less seamless user experience during checkout

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Research and Planning
1. Research available APIs from major food delivery services
2. Evaluate partnership requirements and costs
3. Determine technical feasibility of each integration option
4. Create detailed technical specifications

### Phase 2: Basic Integration
1. Implement restaurant search and selection from delivery services
2. Create embedded view for restaurant menus
3. Develop mechanism for sharing selected restaurant with party members
4. Build basic order aggregation system

### Phase 3: Payment Processing
1. Implement secure payment processing for individual orders
2. Develop system to track and verify payments
3. Create mechanism to aggregate payments on host profile
4. Build refund handling for canceled orders

### Phase 4: Order Submission
1. Develop consolidated order submission to delivery services
2. Implement order tracking and status updates
3. Create notification system for order status
4. Build error handling for failed orders

### Phase 5: Testing and Refinement
1. Conduct thorough testing with multiple delivery services
2. Optimize user experience based on feedback
3. Address edge cases and error scenarios
4. Performance optimization for mobile devices

## Payment Processing Options
1. Stripe Connect - for splitting payments between users
2. PayPal - for peer-to-peer payments
3. Direct integration with delivery service payment systems

## Technical Challenges
1. Session management across multiple users
2. Synchronizing real-time order data
3. Handling payment failures and partial orders
4. Managing delivery service API rate limits
5. Ensuring consistent user experience across different delivery services

## Timeline Estimate
- Phase 1: 2-3 weeks
- Phase 2: 4-6 weeks
- Phase 3: 3-4 weeks
- Phase 4: 3-4 weeks
- Phase 5: 2-3 weeks
- Total: 14-20 weeks

## Next Steps
1. Begin research on delivery service API availability and requirements
2. Contact delivery services regarding partnership opportunities
3. Create proof-of-concept for embedding delivery service interfaces
4. Develop detailed technical specifications for the integration
