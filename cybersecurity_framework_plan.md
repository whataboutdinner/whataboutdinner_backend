# Cybersecurity Framework Implementation Plan - WhatAboutDinner App

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the plan for implementing essential cybersecurity measures within the WhatAboutDinner application. The goal is to protect user data, ensure secure authentication, prevent common web vulnerabilities, and maintain the overall integrity and trustworthiness of the application.

## 2. Key Areas of Focus

### 2.1. Secure Authentication and Session Management
-   **Password Policies:** Enforce strong password requirements (length, complexity).
-   **Secure Password Storage:** Use strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt or Argon2) with salts for storing passwords. Never store plain-text passwords.
-   **Session Management:** Implement secure session handling (e.g., using HttpOnly, Secure cookies, session timeouts, and mechanisms to prevent session fixation and hijacking).
-   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) (Future Consideration):** Plan for potential future implementation of MFA for enhanced security.

### 2.2. Input Validation and Sanitization
-   **Client-Side Validation:** Implement basic input validation on the client-side for better UX, but always rely on server-side validation for security.
-   **Server-Side Validation:** Rigorously validate and sanitize all user inputs on the server-side to prevent injection attacks (XSS, SQLi, NoSQLi, Command Injection).
-   **Output Encoding:** Encode output data correctly to prevent XSS when displaying user-supplied content.

### 2.3. Data Protection
-   **Data Minimization:** Collect and store only the data that is necessary for the application's functionality.
-   **Encryption in Transit:** Ensure all communication between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS (TLS).
-   **Encryption at Rest (if applicable):** For sensitive data stored in the database beyond passwords (e.g., PII if collected), consider encryption at rest.
-   **Regular Backups:** Implement a strategy for regular data backups and a recovery plan.

### 2.4. Protection Against Common Web Vulnerabilities
-   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Mitigate through input sanitization, output encoding, and Content Security Policy (CSP).
-   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Implement anti-CSRF tokens for all state-changing requests.
-   **SQL/NoSQL Injection:** Use parameterized queries or Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) / Object-Document Mappers (ODMs) that inherently protect against these. Sanitize any dynamic query parts if absolutely necessary (avoid if possible).
-   **Security Headers:** Implement important security headers like:
    -   `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP)
    -   `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
    -   `X-Frame-Options: DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN`
    -   `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS)
    -   `Referrer-Policy`
-   **Dependency Management:** Regularly scan and update third-party libraries and dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities (e.g., using `npm audit` for Node.js projects).

### 2.5. API Security (if applicable)
-   **Authentication & Authorization:** Secure API endpoints with robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
-   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and DoS attacks.
-   **Input Validation:** Validate all API inputs.

### 2.6. Logging and Monitoring
-   **Sufficient Logging:** Implement logging for security-relevant events (e.g., login attempts, significant errors, access control failures).
-   **Monitoring & Alerting:** Set up monitoring and alerts for suspicious activities or security breaches.

### 2.7. Secure Development Practices
-   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure components and users only have the permissions necessary to perform their tasks.
-   **Regular Security Audits/Code Reviews:** Conduct security-focused code reviews.
-   **Security Testing:** Incorporate security testing (e.g., SAST, DAST, penetration testing - though full pen-testing might be out of scope for initial development, basic checks are good).

## 3. Implementation Steps (General Approach)

1.  **Review Existing Codebase:** Identify areas where security measures are lacking or need improvement based on the points above.
2.  **Update Dependencies:** Run `npm audit` (or equivalent for the tech stack) and address critical vulnerabilities.
3.  **Implement/Enhance Authentication:** Focus on password hashing and session security.
4.  **Implement Input Validation:** Add server-side validation for all user inputs, especially in forms and API endpoints.
5.  **Implement Output Encoding:** Ensure dynamic content is properly encoded.
6.  **Configure Security Headers:** Add recommended security headers (e.g., via Next.js config or middleware).
7.  **Address CSRF:** Implement anti-CSRF tokens if not already present.
8.  **Review Database Interactions:** Ensure parameterized queries or safe ORM/ODM usage.
9.  **Set up Basic Logging:** For authentication events and critical errors.

## 4. Next Steps for This Project Phase

-   Given this is a Next.js application, focus on:
    -   Ensuring secure API routes (if any are custom beyond NextAuth).
    -   Leveraging NextAuth.js for secure authentication (it handles many aspects like CSRF protection, secure cookies by default if configured correctly).
    -   Implementing robust server-side validation in API routes or server components handling form submissions.
    -   Setting up appropriate security headers in `next.config.js` or middleware.
    -   Reviewing how user data (especially for profiles, recipes, party details) is handled and stored to ensure no unnecessary sensitive data exposure.

This document will serve as a guide during the implementation of these security measures. Specific code changes will be detailed as they are implemented.
